# Entity Framework CodeFirst model for XtraScheduler data binding


<p>This example illustrates how to create an appointment and resource model by using Code First development and then use the types defined in the model as data sources for the SchedulerStorage component in the XtraScheduler WinForms application.</p>
<p>The Color property of the Resource does not necessarily have to be split into ARGB components in the database. It is done in this project for illustrative purpose only. Note that the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerResourceStorageBase_ColorSavingtopic"><u>ColorSaving</u></a> property determines how resource color value is interpreted.</p>
<p>For a walkthrough on data binding with Windows Forms refer to the MSDN article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj682076"><u>Entity Framework: Data Binding with Windows Forms</u></a>.</p>
